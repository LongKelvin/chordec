Description Summary:

Interested in playing a guitar, but unable to hone your basic chords? Chordec provides the suitable platform for you! Using the Android Smartphone's powerful embedded system to analyze sounds emitted from guitar strums, Chordec objectively detects and displays played chords in real time. Guitar players are therefore able to determine their accuracy of strumming chords, by observing the display, and work on areas like fingering or strumming to produce more accurate playing. Furthermore, Chordec provides the foundation for more complex music transcribing or searching applications in the future, through the playing of a musical instrument. Chordec is a guitarist's essential tool.
